I coded this game in Macromedia Flash when I was 15 or 16 years old.
I wondered if I can hack it together again using just C with few libraries.

Some features are:

- Linux Mac and Windows compatible
- Gamepad support (tested: XBox One Wireless & XBox 360)
- HDPI support
- Window and fullscreen mode support
- Proceduraly generated background
